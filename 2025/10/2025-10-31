# 📅 2025-10-31 | Daily Diary

## 🔭 Focus of the Day
> Review paper for IEEE Transactions on Big Data, organize research direction (POV:ResearchStudio), and draft research task structure.

## ✅ Key Wins
- 🎯 Drafted core Zotero taxonomy and research tagging system (#infra)
- 🧠 Clarified naming + mission for POV:ResearchStudio (#insight)
- 🧪 Reviewed intro and contribution framing of Big Data paper (#paper_review)

## 🛠️ Deep Work Blocks
| Start | End   | Activity                                  | Tag              |
|-------|-------|-------------------------------------------|------------------|
| 15:00 | 16:00 | Re-read paper + reviewed Big Data form    | #paper_review    |
| 16:00 | 17:00 | Created agent prompts and conf. strategy  | #infra           |
| 17:30 | 18:30 | Finalized Zotero tags + wrote README.md   | #infra           |

## 📚 Research Log
- **Paper(s) Read**:  
  - *Posterior-Mamba for Multi-Agent Systems* – focuses on replacing Transformers with SSMs like Mamba; unclear scale relevance to Big Data. (#paper_review, #method)
- **Ideas Sparked**:  
  - Use POV:ResearchStudio as umbrella for my safety+planning+vision research (#idea)
  - Build a conf-tracking agent to keep updated with top 20 robotics/ML/vision confs (#infra)

## 🧵 Content Creation
- **Drafted**:  
  - Post idea around 1X Neo + robotics visibility (#draft)
- **Published**:  
  - None
- **Engagement Goals**:
  - Position myself as aware, connected, and critically engaged in humanoid robotics conversation (#content)

## 🌱 Japanese Practice
- **Lesson / Activity**: Lesson 10-1 – 「A を（wear: verb て）いる」 grammar structure  
- **Time spent**: 1 hour  
- **Interesting Note**: Differentiated verbs like きる (wear), かける (glasses), かぶる (hat), はく (pants), する (accessories)

## 🧠 Reflections
- Felt slow to start — didn’t get to computer until 15:00
- Once active, got meaningful systems in place (tagging, group name, etc.)
- Partial progress on review; could finish it tomorrow with tighter session

## 📍 Tomorrow Priorities
- [ ] Finalize Big Data review form and submit
- [ ] Begin GMI NeurIPS scouting (papers for pilot content)
- [ ] Review at least 1 GitHub simulation environment
